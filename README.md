# node-js-getting-started


Goal of the project is to associate each sensor with a neighborhood or district and give it an identity.

We conducted several experiments to capture the pulse or identity of a neighborhood.

You and try them out and modify them here.

We also created an app that combines and compares these experiments for 140 neighborhoods in 10 cities. 

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd node-js-getting-started
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
