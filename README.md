# Urban Heartbeat

Urban Heartbeat is an civic art project that explores the pulse of places in cities around the world. The project is part of the Data Canvas: Sense Your City competition, a DIY sensor project.

We will conduct several experiments based upon different environmental factors, such as pollution, noise, dust, and light. Each experiment explores a different factor using a different medium or visualization technique.

The experiment will be created over the course of a 2 weeks. We encourage you check out the experiments here: [Link to various Code Pen experiments]. You can also fork these experiments into new ones and contribute to the project.

On March 20th, we'll combine the experiments into web app that allows users to compare experiments across all 140 places in 10 international cities. See it at  http://urban-heartbeat.net/

## Background
To state the obvious: Cities are for People. Not Machines. Not Data Scientists. Not Corporations.

Places in neighborhoods are also really hard to quanitfy. Places change dramatically during the course of a day and over months.
